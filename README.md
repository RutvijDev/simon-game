## Tech Stack

1.  Press any key (or tap the screen on mobile) to start the game.
2.  Simon will flash the first color in the sequence.
3.  Click the button corresponding to the color that flashed.
4.  Simon will repeat the sequence and add one new color.
5.  Continue following the sequence for as long as you can! If you make a mistake, the game will end and show your score.
